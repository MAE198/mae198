												<h3>David Dalicandro</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Hello, my name is David Dalicandro.  I am currently the Lead and Student Coordinator for MAE 198.  I am a 4th year undergraduate student at University of California San Diego and I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis in Renewable Energy and Environmental Flows.  I am also minoring in Environmental Systems.  I enjoy doing anything athletic and outside, including skiing and hiking.  Growing up around Lake Tahoe, I developed an extreme regard for the environment and want to preserve the environment and nature to the best of my ability.  This is why I want to go into the Renewable Energy Field once I graduate.</p>
											<p>I joined MAE 198 because I want to encourage and inspire younger students to go on and become better engineers than I will be, and to spark an interest in engineering for students who may not have otherwise been introduced to the engineering fields.  I was told to go into engineering because I was good at math and science, but it wasn’t until I was introduced to the different fields of engineering in high school that I knew that engineering was my right calling.  I was lucky that my high school provided this opportunity to me and I want to be able to provide the opportunity for younger students to find their calling as well.</p>

												<h3>Trinity Pike</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Hello! My name is Trinity, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a mechanical engineering student graduating in June 2021. I am passionate about using my technical skills to help others, so I was drawn to humanitarian engineering early on in my academic career. To pursue this interest, I am currently a Co-President of Engineers Without Borders at UC San Diego, and I also do research with Project Lim[b]itless to make prosthetic limbs more accessible and affordable. I also love giving back to my community, so I do a lot of teaching inside and outside of class. MAE 198 allows me to embrace my love for outreach and support the next generation of STEM! In the future, I am interested in exploring nanomaterials and bioengineering. </p>

												<h3>Yusuf Shehata</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Hi there! My name is Yusuf Shehata and I’m a 1st year aerospace major and Jacobs Scholar at UCSD. I moved from the California Central Valley for the opportunity to pursue my engineering passion while enjoying the beach! I’ve played soccer my whole life up until college and continue to play recreationally, and I also love to play video games. I’m a food and movie junkie, and love going on new adventures whether that be exploring new places here in San Diego or meeting new people. I’m currently a member of campus organization Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (RPL) and I hope to eventually take my engineering passion to the next level working for companies such as NASA or SpaceX, or potentially my own startup. I joined MAE 198 to spread this passion to those interested in the field themselves, as well as make valuable connections along the way!</p>

												<h3>Ernesto Suarez</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Ernesto Suarez, and my pronouns are he/him/his. I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego majoring in Aerospace Engineering. With that being said, space has always been a huge passion of mine and is one of the main reasons why I took on the role of Lead Systems Engineer for an organization on campus called Rocket Propulsion Laboratory. I am also involved in a research project where we are coming up with a passive, efficient, and affordable way to desalinate water to provide fresh water for communities who need it. My professional goal is to one day work for NASA and be a part of the lunar missions and further space exploration, but my personal goal is to give back as much as I can to everyone who has helped me get to where I am.</p>

											<h3>Ricardo González</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Hey y’all, my name is Ricardo González I’m a fourth year Mechanical Engineer minoring in Business. A couple of my hobbies include, playing basketball and league of legends. I also thoroughly enjoy exploring after I graduate I hope to travel Asia and Europe and experience a bunch of new cultures. My reason for doing MAE 198 is because I would like to give the younger generations a taste of engineering so that they can be better prepared when they come into college. In the future I hope to be able to combine my business and engineering degrees to be able to start my own company focused on improving technology used in the healthcare field.</p>
